    problem: "AtlasOS grew rapidly in 2023 thanks to extensive coverage in various tech media and YouTube channels aimed at a tech-savvy audience. In line with this, AtlasOS felt the need to update its existing visual identity, so that everything would be unified once and for all.",
    solution: "Based on the then existing AtlasOS identity, a new logo, a new font, new colours and so much more had to be created â€” all to keep everything as consistent as possible with what already existed, so as not to lose the recognition of what was already well established.",
    process: "The job started quickly because the Atlas icon already existed. All that was needed were adjustments to the proportions and a general clean-up to begin the larger work of transforming the icon into the tight, crisp A icon that exists today. From there, a lot of work was done to ensure that all the different variations of the logo that might be needed exist, background images for launches exist, and an open, transparent and clear brand book that anyone in their community could pick up and understand how the brand identity should be used properly.",
    results: "The result of the AtlasOS brand overhaul was a much sharper visual expression, a clearer and more unified set of rules and materials to use across their various platforms and products, and last but not least, a community that appreciated and celebrated the new, updated look that Atlas had achieved.",
