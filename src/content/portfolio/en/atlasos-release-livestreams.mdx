    problem: "AtlasOS rarely released updates, but when updates were released, they covered many new features, bug fixes and general improvements. But a regular changelog found AtlasOS did not do the updates enough justice.",
    solution: "The solution we came up with was a unique live stream for each new release where the main developers behind AtlasOS went through the big and the small of each update, with space to answer the audience's questions live via their used chat platform Discord.",
    process: "The request was simple and did not require much preparation. The structure and technology behind it was built on the fact that the live stream would be visible both on YouTube and in their Discord server as a form of panel channel. I proactively created the graphics before the broadcast and got the go-ahead on its quality well in advance. The broadcast was broadcast in two channels (YouTube and Discord) with the possibility to bring in guests for real-time questions to the developers, as well as the developers being able to share their screens directly in the live stream. Communication and scheduling for the broadcast was handled by me via the Ontime platform and the live stream was produced using OBS.",
    results: "The result was a highly appreciated livestream, both by the AtlasOS community and their volunteers. The broadcast became a way for AtlasOS to interact with its users, while giving users a chance to get real-time updates and ask all their questions.",
