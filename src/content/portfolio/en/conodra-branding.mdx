    problem: "Condora had nothing more than a domain and a name for their company, but to drive the company's journey forward, their visual identity needed to be created and communicated effectively.",
    solution: "The solution was simply to create a toolbox of brand assets that Conodra could use over the coming years. From separate icons and identities for their different services and product lines, to a concrete and detailed brand book that set boundaries and principles for how all materials should be used.",
    process: "The work process itself was extremely smooth, and much of the creative freedom was in my hands. Condora didn't bring any exact requirements into the project and therefore let it take its own direction to move forward. The colours and fonts, Sharp Sans Display No. 2, were quickly agreed upon, as were the icons for their various product lines. The logo and brand book were built side by side at the same time, with the team at Condora having visibility into every step of the process.",
    results: "The result was a complete brand kit with logos, icons, colours, guidelines and everything in between that Condora can use throughout its corporate journey. A toolbox filled with visual assets that marketing managers and developers alike can easily understand and utilise.",
