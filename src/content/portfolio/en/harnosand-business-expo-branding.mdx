    problem: "In connection with a major project with ExtenseIT and Företagarna Härnösand, a simpler brand identity needed to be designed for the event that Företagarna was to organise - Härnösand Business Expo.",
    solution: "ExtenseIT took responsibility for finding a subcontractor for the task of creating the brand identity, along with some practical mockups and simple printing for merchandise.",
    process: "Företagarna Härnösand and the event board presented inspirational material from Företagarna's existing brand and the place brand for Härnösand Höga Kusten. Based on this, work began on creating a suitable icon that followed a similar visual structure. We worked together with Företagarna until we reached a brand identity that they were happy with. Then some mockups and designs for print and marketing were produced to show how the logo could be used in practice.",
    results: "A simple brand kit with logo, colours, fonts and visual examples of how the material can be used to create something bigger was delivered to Företagarna and ExtenseIT to take the project forward.",
