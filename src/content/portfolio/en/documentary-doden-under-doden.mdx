    problem: "In conjunction with the completion of my media studies at Anderstorpsgymnasiet in Skellefteå, an independent film idea of choice was to be produced and submitted as a final project to set the final grade in the course Film and TV production.",
    solution: "Having always liked documentaries, I decided that my final film would be a short documentary. In this case, it is about working with death every day as an undertaker.",
    process: "FThe pre-production of Döden under döden involved first contacting an undertaker, in this case Fonus Skellefteå, who welcomed me and my idea with open arms. There I got to follow Jenny Bohman Schneider and Patrik Karlsson for two days to both ask my questions and get their answers in an interview, as well as collect B-roll material of their work, which the whole documentary is based on. I later did the sound mixing, editing and colour correction on my own in order to submit a final project for the course.",
    results: "Döden under döden passed the course and was submitted to the Västerbotten Film Festival, VAFF, in the summer of 2024. The film was also shown at the Trästock Festival 2024 in connection with their programme ‘Trästock <3 Film’.",
