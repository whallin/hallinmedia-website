    problem: "MR-dagarna wanted to have video interviews with volunteers at the event to publish on their various channels to recruit new volunteers for future event days.",
    solution: "The solution was to organise short interviews with some volunteers on the show floor, ask similar questions, and then edit them into longer interviews, accompanied by the appropriate B-roll.",
    process: "The media officer of the 2024 MR-dagarna at Sara Kulturhus planned some basic questions and suggested volunteers to interview. The interviews were conducted with a reporter asking the questions while I handled the audio and videography. The raw material was then edited together, and the audio was mixed by me with supervision and feedback from the same media officer who assisted well on site. Graphics (nameplates, logos, etc.) and subtitling were handled by the in-house MR-dagarna team.",
    results: "The result was three interviews that could be published as one long video or as three separate interview clips, accompanied by the relevant B-roll for each individual interview. The interviews would be published on the typical MR-dagarna channels: Instagram, Facebook and YouTube.",
