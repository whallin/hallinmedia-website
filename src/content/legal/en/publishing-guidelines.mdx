## Model Release Requirements

This section outlines the legal requirements for using images or videos that include recognizable individuals. Model releases act as binding agreements between the subjects and content users, protecting all parties by defining the permitted contexts for usage. This process ensures compliance with privacy laws and ethical journalism standards.

- **Mandatory for**:

  - Editorial content depicting sensitive situations (medical, legal, or private settings)
  - Any usage involving minors (under 18 years) as primary subjects
- **Not required for**:

  - Incidental appearances in public spaces
  - Editorial content with newsworthiness exemption

### How It Works

  - No direct identification through captioning
  - Blurring required for any enhanced focus in post-production

### Release Documentation Standards

  - HallinMedia release template (see Appendix A)
  - Government-issued ID verification
  - Usage scope declaration matching final publication
- **Retention requirements**:
  - Maintain digital copies for 7 years post-publication

  - Update for material usage changes exceeding original scope

### Usage Limitations

Even with valid releases, usage is prohibited in, but not limited to:

- Adult entertainment contexts
- Political endorsement materials

### Verification Process

2. Receive a validation code from [legal@newgent.digital](mailto:legal@newgent.digital).
3. Include the code in the publication metadata field "MRR-XXXX".
4. Maintain accessible records for 36 months after publishing.

For exclusive rights holders, release requirements may be modified according to your licensing agreement. Always consult the [Image Licensing Policy](/legal/image-licensing) before publication.
