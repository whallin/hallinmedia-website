Thank you for deciding to work with HallinMedia. These guidelines establish specific requirements for publishing any material obtained through our services, including images, videos, text, and derivative works, whether for commercial, editorial, or personal use.

### Key Purpose

## Model Release Requirements

This section describes the legal requirements for using images or videos containing identifiable individuals. Model releases serve as binding agreements between subjects and content users, protecting all parties by defining the permitted contexts of use. This process guarantees adherence to privacy laws and ethical journalism standards.

- **Mandatory for**:
  - Commercial use with identifiable individuals.
  - Editorial content depicting sensitive situations (medical, legal, or private settings).
  - Use of minors (under 18 years) as primary subjects.
- **Not required for**:
  - Unfocused crowd scenes.
  - Incidental appearances in public spaces.
  - Editorial content with a newsworthiness exemption.

### How It Works

1. Licensees sign releases using the Appendix A template and provide documentation for pre-approval verification.
2. Obtain a unique validation code for publication metadata.
3. Keep accessible records in accordance with retention requirements.

### Minor and Incidental Appearance Rules

#### Under 18 years

- Requires dual consent (parent/guardian + minor over 13).
- Valid for up to three years or until the age of eighteen (whichever comes first).

#### Incidental use

- Up to 25% of frame composition.
- Captioning does not provide direct identification.
- Post-production focus enhancement requires blurring.

### Release Documentation Standards

#### Must include

- HallinMedia release template (refer to Appendix A).
- Government-issued ID verification.
- Usage scope declaration matches the final publication.

#### Retention criteria

- Maintain digital copies for 7 years after publication.
- Provide compliance audits on request.
- Update for material usage changes that exceed the original scope.

### Usage Limitations

Even with legitimate releases, usage is prohibited in, but not limited to:

- Adult entertainment contexts.
- Political endorsement materials.
- AI/ML Training Datasets.
- Defamatory or libellous content.

### Verification Process

1. Submit the release documentation 14 days before publication.
2. Obtain a validation code from [legal@newgent.digital](mailto:legal@newgent.digital).
3. Enter the code in the publication metadata field "MRR-XXXXYY-HM".
4. Keep accessible records for 36 months after publication.

Exclusive rights holders' release requirements may be modified in accordance with your licensing agreement. Always read the [Image Licensing Policy](/legal/image-licensing) before publishing.
