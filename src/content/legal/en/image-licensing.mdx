## 1. Introduction

This licensing agreement (the "Agreement") governs the terms for use of image material, photographs, illustrations and other visual works (the "Image Material") provided by HallinMedia (the "Licensor", "we", "us", "our") to the user of the Image Material (the "Licensee", "you", "your"). By using our Image Material, you accept the terms of this Agreement.

This Agreement constitutes a legally binding contract between the Licensor and the Licensee. If you do not accept the terms of this Agreement, you shall not use the Image Material.

## 2. Definitions

In this Agreement, the following definitions apply:

- **Image Material**: All photographs, illustrations, graphic design, digital images, video material and other visual works provided by the Licensor.

- **Commercial Use**: Use that directly or indirectly promotes a product, service, idea, person or organisation operated for profit or other business benefit.

- **Editorial Use**: Use for informative, educational or journalistic purposes that does not promote or advertise a product, person, service or company.

- **License Fee**: The financial compensation paid by the Licensee to the Licensor for the right to use the Image Material.

- **Scope of Use**: The specific media, territories and contexts in which the Licensee has the right to use the Image Material.

## 3. Grant of License

### 3.1 Scope of License

In exchange for payment of the agreed License Fee, the Licensor grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Image Material in accordance with the conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement and in the specific licensing agreement made between the parties.

The license only covers the specific usage rights explicitly granted and does not include any other rights concerning the Image Material or its content.

### 3.2 Types of Licenses

Depending on the agreement between the parties, the following types of licenses may be granted:

#### 3.2.1 Standard License

A standard license gives the Licensee the right to use the Image Material for defined purposes within specified areas of use for a specified period of time. The standard license typically includes use in:

- Web publications
- Printed material with limited circulation
- Social media in connection with the company's operations
- Internal corporate communication

#### 3.2.2 Extended License

An extended license gives the Licensee more extensive rights and may include:

- The right to use the Image Material in commercial products intended for sale
- Use in extensive advertising campaigns
- Right to make minor modifications to the Image Material
- Use in multiple defined channels over a longer period of time

#### 3.2.3 Exclusive License

An exclusive license gives the Licensee sole right to use the Image Material within specified areas of use during the license period. The Licensor therefore refrains from the right to license the same Image Material to others within the agreed area of use during the license period.

Exclusive licenses are time-limited and may be industry- or geographically restricted.

### 3.3 License Period

Unless otherwise expressly agreed, the license is valid for a period of twelve (12) months from the date the Licensee obtains access to the Image Material.

For permanent licenses ("buyouts"), special terms apply as specified in a separate addendum.
