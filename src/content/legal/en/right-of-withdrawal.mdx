This document describes your right to withdraw from your purchase of services from HallinMedia ("we", "us", "our") in accordance with Swedish consumer law and the EU Consumer Rights Directive. The right of withdrawal is an important consumer right that allows you to withdraw from the contract under certain conditions.

## 1. General Information about the Right of Withdrawal

### 1.1 Scope

As a consumer, you have the legal right to withdraw from your purchase within 14 days of entering into the contract, without having to provide any specific reason. This right of withdrawal applies to private individuals acting as consumers within the EU/EEA.

### 1.2 Application

The right of withdrawal applies to all services covered by the Distance Contracts Act, with certain exceptions as specified in section 4. For business customers (B2B), special conditions apply according to our general terms of business.

## 2. Duration of Withdrawal Period

### 2.1 Calculation of the Withdrawal Period

The withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day when the contract was entered into. If the last day of the withdrawal period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday, the period is extended until the next working day.

### 2.2 When the Withdrawal Period Begins

- **For purchase of services**: From the day when the contract is entered into
- **For purchase of digital content**: From the day when the contract is entered into, provided you have not expressly consented to delivery during the withdrawal period

## 3. How to Exercise Your Right of Withdrawal

### 3.1 Notice of Withdrawal

To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision to withdraw from the contract through a clear and unambiguous notice. This can be done in the following ways:

- Email: william@hallin.media
- Telephone: [+46 70-615 92 79](tel:+46706159279)

### 3.2 Standard Form

You may use the standard withdrawal form available on the Swedish Consumer Agency's website, but this is not mandatory. The important thing is that your message clearly indicates your wish to withdraw from the purchase.

### 3.3 Confirmation

We will send confirmation of receipt of your notice of withdrawal without undue delay.

## 4. Exceptions to the Right of Withdrawal

### 4.1 Completed Services

The right of withdrawal does not apply to services that have been completed if:

- You have expressly consented to the service beginning during the withdrawal period
- You have acknowledged that the right of withdrawal is lost when the service is completed

### 4.2 Digital Content

The right of withdrawal does not apply to digital content delivered by means other than on a physical medium if:

- Delivery has begun with your express prior consent
- You have acknowledged that the right of withdrawal is thereby lost

### 4.3 Customised Services

Special conditions may apply for services that are customised to your specifications. This will be clearly communicated before purchase.

## 5. Effects of Exercising the Right of Withdrawal

### 5.1 Refund

If you exercise your right of withdrawal, we will reimburse all payments received from you, without undue delay and no later than 14 days from the day we were informed of your decision to withdraw from the contract.

### 5.2 Refund Method

The refund will be made using the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction unless expressly agreed otherwise. Under no circumstances will you be charged any fees as a result of the refund.

## 6. Services Begun During the Withdrawal Period

### 6.1 Proportional Payment

If you have requested that services begin during the withdrawal period, you are obliged to pay an amount proportional to the extent of the service performed up until you notified us of your wish to withdraw from the contract.

### 6.2 Calculation of Proportional Amount

The proportional amount is calculated based on the total price agreed in the contract. If the total price is unreasonably high, the proportional amount is calculated based on the market value of what has been delivered.
