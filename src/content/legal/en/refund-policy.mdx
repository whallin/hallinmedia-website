## 1. Introduction

This policy (the "Policy") describes the rules and procedures for refunds and right of withdrawal for services provided by HallinMedia ("we", "us", "our"). The Policy is designed to ensure fairness and transparency for both customers and HallinMedia.

By using our services, you accept these terms and understand that they may be updated from time to time in accordance with applicable legislation. The latest version of this policy is always available on our website www.hallin.media.

## 2. Consumer Right of Withdrawal

### 2.1 14-day Right of Withdrawal

As a consumer, under applicable consumer protection legislation, you have the right to withdraw from a contract (cancel your purchase) within 14 days from when the contract was entered into, without giving any reason. This period is called the "withdrawal period".

However, the right of withdrawal does not apply in the following cases:

- If you have expressly agreed that the service may begin during the withdrawal period and have been informed that the right of withdrawal will thereby be lost
- For digital products delivered through download, after the download has begun with your consent
- For bespoke products or services manufactured according to your specific requirements

### 2.2 How to Exercise Your Right of Withdrawal

To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision to withdraw from the contract through an unambiguous statement before the withdrawal period has expired. This can be done in the following ways:

- Via email to william@hallin.media
- Via post to our registered business address

In your message, you must clearly state:

- Your name and contact details
- Clear information about the ordered service
- Date of order
- Request for refund

We recommend that you keep a copy of your message for your own records. Upon receipt of your message, we will promptly send confirmation that we have received your withdrawal notice.

### 2.3 Effect of Exercised Right of Withdrawal

When you exercise your right of withdrawal, we will reimburse all payments received from you, without undue delay and no later than 14 days from the day we were informed of your decision to withdraw from the contract. The refund will be made using the same payment method you used for the purchase, unless otherwise agreed.

## 3. Refund Policy for Commenced Projects

### 3.1 Consultancy Services and Time-based Assignments

For consultancy services and time-based assignments, the following refund rules apply:

- **Hours worked**: Hours already performed are charged in full according to the agreed hourly rate
- **Booked but not commenced hours**: Fully refunded if cancellation occurs at least 24 hours before planned start
- **Emergency services**: Special terms may apply for emergency services booked at short notice

This ensures that the customer only pays for time actually worked, while allowing us to plan our operations effectively.

### 3.2 Project-based Assignments

For project-based assignments with a fixed total price, the following refund structure applies:

- **Before project start**: Upon cancellation before project start, 90% of the total amount is refunded. An administration fee of 10% is retained to cover project planning and resource allocation costs.
- **During project progress**: Upon cancellation during an ongoing project:
  - Completed parts are charged in full (100%)
  - Started but incomplete parts are charged at 50% of agreed price
  - Not started parts are refunded in full (100%)

To determine the project status and extent of refund, a detailed status report will be prepared in connection with the cancellation. This report will specify which parts are considered completed, started, or not started.

### 3.3 Monthly Services and Subscriptions

For monthly services and subscriptions, the following refund rules apply:

- Refunds are made for entire unused months
- Started months are not refunded, regardless of when during the month cancellation occurs
- For advance payments for longer periods, special terms may apply as agreed

Cancellation of monthly services should be made in writing at least 30 days before the next billing period to avoid charges for the upcoming period.

## 4. Special Terms

### 4.1 Bespoke Products and Services

For bespoke services and products developed specifically for the customer, special terms apply:

- Refunds may be limited if the service or product is specially adapted and cannot be used for other customers
- Design, code, and other customised solutions developed specifically for customer needs are subject to special considerations
- Advance payments for materials or third-party services may have limited refund possibilities depending on our agreements with these suppliers

In each individual case, we strive to find a fair solution that considers both the customer's and our interests.

### 4.2 Digital Products

For digital products, the following special terms apply:

- When a digital product has been delivered and can be downloaded or made available to the customer, the right of withdrawal normally ceases
- This assumes that the customer has expressly agreed that delivery may begin and that the right of withdrawal is thereby lost
- For digital subscription services, the terms in section 3.3 above apply

The customer will always be clearly informed of these limitations before the purchase is completed.

## 5. Refund Process

### 5.1 Timeframe for Refunds

We strive to handle all refunds efficiently and transparently:

- Refund requests are processed within 5 working days of receipt
- The actual refund is completed within 14 working days of approved request
- For complex matters, longer processing times may occur, which we will then inform about

Refunds are always made to the same payment method used for the purchase, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

### 5.2 Required Documentation

To facilitate a smooth refund process, we ask you to provide the following documentation:

- Receipt or invoice number
- Order date and reference number (if available)
- Account details for refund (if applicable)
- Detailed description of the reason for refund request

Incomplete information may delay the refund process.

## 6. Exceptions to the Right of Refund

Refunds are not granted in the following situations:

- In case of violation of our terms of use or agreements
- If the service has been delivered in its entirety as agreed and in a professional manner
- In force majeure situations beyond HallinMedia's control, such as natural disasters, extensive technical disruptions, labour market conflicts or similar
- If the customer has failed to follow reasonable instructions or recommendations from us that are necessary for the correct implementation of the service

We reserve the right to review each refund request individually to ensure it does not conflict with these exceptions.

## 7. Disputes and Mediation

In the event of a dispute regarding refund or right of withdrawal, we will:

1. First attempt to resolve the matter through direct dialogue with the customer
2. If needed, offer mediation through an impartial third party
3. As a last resort, refer the matter to the National Board for Consumer Disputes (ARN) or competent court

We always strive to reach a solution that is acceptable to all parties involved.

## 8. Changes to the Policy

HallinMedia reserves the right to update this policy. Changes will:

- Be published on our website with clear information about what has changed
- Take effect 30 days after publication, unless otherwise stated
- Not affect already entered agreements, unless the change is to the customer's advantage

We recommend that you regularly review this policy to stay informed about any changes.
