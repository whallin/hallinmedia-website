# Legal Document Roadmap for Swedish AB

---

"Based on the already existing legal documents in the /legal/ directory, create the following additional legal documents for me:

- Licensing Agreement

See todo.mdx for the purpose of these documents, and see content.config.ts for the full legalCollection content schema.

Only write the Swedish version of these documents, as I'll manually translate it into English later.

You must keep a similiar layout, tonality, structure, flow, and level of legal protection as the already exisiting legal documents in the legal content directory."
