## Introduction

This document outlines your statutory right to withdraw from purchases made through our platform within 14 days, as per EU Directive 2011/83/EU on consumer rights and Sweden's Distance and Off-Premises Contracts Act (SFS 2005:59). This protection only applies to consumer transactions (B2C), in which goods or services are purchased without a face-to-face interaction.

## Your Right to Withdraw

You have the legal right to withdraw from this contract within 14 calendar days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period:

- Starts the day after you receive the physical goods.
- For service contracts, begins from the contract agreement date.
- For multi-item orders, begins when the final item is received.

For digital content, your right to withdraw expires once we begin performance with your explicit consent and acknowledgement that you will lose cancellation rights. The 14-day period includes weekends and public holidays; if the final day falls on a weekend or holiday, it is extended to the following business day.
