            William Hallin is a freelance photographer and video producer based in Skellefteå, Västerbotten County.
            Since his early years, Hallin has shown great interest in media production and graphic design, and this

            During the later years of high school, William Hallin began his freelance work properly, with the start of
            the limited liability company Newgent Digital and HallinMedia as brands. Freelancing started in the live and
            TV production industry, but has slowly but surely shifted to more general photo and video productions for
            corporate clients and journalistic media houses of various kinds.
